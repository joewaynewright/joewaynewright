      <description>Come NFL Draft season, no prospect testing metric is talked about more than the prestigious 40-yard dash. This famous sprint tasks NFL hopefuls with covering 40 yards of ground in the fastest time possible.

But is the 40-yard dash a predictor for NFL success?</description>

It is a purposefully subjective award that stirs the pot and incites heated arguments between both media members and fans about what value really means in the NBA.
While this debate is a fascinating discussion, I want to look at player value in a much broader sense.</description>
