      <description>One of the longest held debates amongst NBA fanatics is over which player deserves the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for each given season. It is a purposefully subjective award that stirs the pot and incites heated arguments between both media members and fans about what value really means in the NBA.
While this debate is a fascinating discussion, I want to look at player value in a broader sense.</description>

      <description>This is a faux post for my website so I can get the hang of posting blogs! For my big project this semester, I’m interested in finding out what position in the NBA is the most important? I want to analyze which position brings a team the most win shares and which players in said positions are outliers. I’m also interested in finding out which position has the best shooting percentages, turnover ratio and more!</description>
